# Tonal and Nagual

### Restaurant explanation

Now I will tell you the sorcerers' explanation."  
He paused again, rubbed his cheeks, and played with his tongue inside his mouth as if he were feeling his teeth.  
"I'm going to tell you about the tonal and the nagual" he said and looked at me piercingly.  
...  
"**This is my tonal**" don Juan said, rubbing his hands on his chest.  
"Your suit?"  
"No. **My person.**"  
He pounded his chest and his thighs and the side of his ribs.  
"My tonal is all this."  
He explained that **every human being had two sides; two separate entities; two counterparts which became operative at the moment of birth. One was called the 'tonal' and the other the 'nagual'**.  
...

"This time I need your undivided attention since I am going to acquaint you with the tonal and the nagual. Sorcerers have a special and unique interest in that knowledge. I would say that the tonal and the nagual are in the exclusive realm of men of knowledge.

...  
"I'm using your own words now," he said. "**The tonal is the social person.**"  
He laughed, I supposed, at the sight of my bewilderment.  
"The **tonal is rightfully so, a protector; a guardian - a guardian that most of the time turns into a guard.**"  
I fumbled with my notebook. I was trying to pay attention to what he was saying. He laughed and mimicked my nervous movements.  
"The **tonal is the organizer of the world,**" he proceeded. "Perhaps the best way of describing its monumental **work is to say** that on its shoulders rests the task of **setting the chaos of the world in order**. It is not farfetched to maintain, as sorcerers do, that everything we know and do as men is the work of the tonal. "At this moment, for instance, what is engaged in trying to make sense out of our conversation is your tonal. Without it there would be only weird sounds and grimaces, and you wouldn't understand a thing of what I'm saying.  
"I would say then that the **tonal is a guardian that protects something priceless; our very being**. Therefore an inherent quality of the tonal is to be cagey and jealous of its doings. And since its doings are by far the most important part of our lives, it is no wonder that it eventually changes in every one of us from a guardian into a guard."  
He stopped and asked me if I had understood. I automatically nodded my head affirmatively, and he smiled with an air of incredulity.  
"A guardian is broad-minded and understanding," he explained. "A guard, on the other hand, is a vigilante; narrow-minded and most of the time despotic. I say then that the tonal in all of us has been made into a petty and despotic guard when it should be a broad-minded guardian."  
...  
"The **tonal is everything we are,**" he proceeded. "Name it! Anything we have a word for is the tonal. And since the tonal is its own doings, then everything, obviously, has to fall under its domain."  
I reminded him that he had said that the 'tonal' was the social person, a term which I myself had used with him to mean a human being as the end result of socialization processes. I pointed out that if the 'tonal' was that product, it could not be everything, as he had said, because the world around us was not the product of socialization.  
Don Juan reminded me that my argument had no basis for him, and that long before he had already made the point that there was no world at large but **only a description of the world** which we had learned to visualize and take for granted.  
"The **tonal is everything we know,**" he said. "I think this in itself is enough reason for the tonal to be such an overpowering affair."  
...  
"The **tonal is everything we know,**" he repeated slowly. "And that includes not only us as persons, but everything in our world. It can be said that the tonal is everything that meets the eye.  
"We begin to groom it at the moment of birth. The moment we take the first gasp of air we also breathe in power for the tonal. So it is proper to say that the tonal of a human being is intimately tied to his birth.  
"You must remember this point. It is of great importance in understanding all this. The **tonal begins at birth and ends at death.**". ...  
"I still cannot understand, don Juan, what you mean by the statement that the tonal is everything," I said after a moment's pause.  
"The tonal is what makes the world."  
"Is the tonal the creator of the world?"  
Don Juan scratched his temples.  
"The **tonal makes the world only in a manner of speaking**. It cannot create or change anything, and yet it makes the world because its function is to judge, and assess, and witness. I say that the tonal makes the world because it witnesses and assesses it according to tonal rules. In a very strange manner, the tonal is a creator that doesn't create a thing. In other words, the tonal makes up the rules by which it apprehends the world. So, in a manner of speaking, it creates the world."  
...  
"The tonal is an island," he explained. "The best way of describing it is to say that the tonal is this."  
He ran his hand over the table top.  
"We can say that the tonal is like the top of this table. An island. And on this island we have everything. This island is, in fact, the world.  
"There is a personal tonal for every one of us, and there is a collective one for all of us at any given time which we can call the tonal of the times." He pointed to the rows of tables in the restaurant.  
"Look! Every table has the same configuration. Certain items are present on all of them. They are, however, individually different from each other. Some tables are more crowded than others. They have different food on them, different plates, different atmosphere, yet we have to admit that all the tables in this restaurant are very alike.  
The same thing happens with the tonal. We can say that the tonal of the times is what makes us alike in the same way it makes all the tables in this restaurant alike. Each table separately, nevertheless, is an individual case just like the personal tonal of each of us. But the important factor to keep in mind is that everything we know about ourselves and about our world is on the island of the tonal. See what I mean?"  
"If the tonal is everything we know about ourselves and our world, what then is the nagual?"  
"The nagual is the part of us which we do not deal with at all."  
"I beg your pardon?"  
"The nagual is the partv of us for which there is no description: no words, no names, no feelings, no knowledge."  
"That's a contradiction, don Juan. In my opinion, if it can't be felt or described or named, it cannot exist."  
"It's a contradiction only in your opinion. I warned you before, don't knock yourself out trying to understand this."  
"Would you say that the nagual is the mind?"  
"No. The mind is an item on the table. The mind is part of the tonal. Let's say that the mind is the chili sauce."  
He took a bottle of sauce and placed it in front of me.  
"Is the nagual the soul?"  
"No. The soul is also on the table. Let's say that the soul is the ashtray."  
"Is it the thoughts of men?"  
"No. Thoughts are also on the table. Thoughts are like the silverware."  
He picked up a fork and placed it next to the chili sauce and the ashtray.  
"Is it a state of grace? Heaven?"  
"Not that either. That, whatever it might be, is also part of the tonal. It is, let's say, the napkin."  
I went on giving possible ways of describing what he was alluding to: pure intellect, psyche, energy, vital force, immortality, life principle. For each thing I named he found an item on the table to serve as a counterpart and shoved it in front of me until he had all the objects on the table stashed in one pile.  
Don Juan seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. He giggled and rubbed his hands every time I named another possibility.  
"Is the nagual the Supreme Being; the Almighty, God?" I asked.  
"No. God is also on the table. Let's say that God is the tablecloth."  
He made a joking gesture of pulling the tablecloth in order to stack it up with the rest of the items he had put in front of me.  
"But, are you saying that God does not exist?"  
"No. I didn't say that. All I said was that the nagual was not God because God is an item of our personal tonal and of the tonal of the times. The tonal is, as I've already said, everything we think the world is composed of, including God, of course. God has no more importance other than being a part of the tonal of our time."  
"In my understanding, don Juan, God is everything. Aren't we talking about the same thing?"  
"No. God is only everything you can think of, therefore, properly speaking, he is only another item on the island. God cannot be witnessed at will, he can only be talked about.  
"The nagual, on the other hand, is at the service of the warrior. It can be witnessed, but it cannot be talked about."  
"If the nagual is not any of the things I have mentioned," I said, "perhaps you can tell me about its location. Where is it?"  
Don Juan made a sweeping gesture and pointed to the area beyond the boundaries of the table. He swept his hand, as if with the back of it he were cleaning an imaginary surface that went beyond the edges of the table.  
"The nagual is there," he said. "There, surrounding the island. The nagual is there, where power hovers.  
"We sense, from the moment we are born, that there are two parts to us. At the time of birth, and for a while after, we are all nagual. We sense, then, that in order to function we need a counterpart to what we have. The tonal is missing and that gives us, from the very beginning, a feeling of incompleteness.  
"Then the **tonal starts to develop and it becomes utterly important** to our functioning; so important that it **opaques the shine of the nagual. It overwhelms it.** From the moment we become all tonal, we do nothing else but to increment that old feeling of incompleteness which accompanies us from the moment of our birth, and which tells us constantly that there is another part to give us completeness.  
"From the moment **we become all tonal we begin making pairs. We sense our two sides, but we always represent them with items of the tonal.** We say that the two parts of us are the soul and the body. Or mind and matter. Or good and evil. God and Satan.  
"We never realize, however, that we are merely pairing things on the island, very much like pairing coffee and tea, or bread and tortillas, or chili and mustard. I tell you, we are weird animals. We get carried away, and in our madness we believe ourselves to be making perfect sense."  
Don Juan stood up and addressed me as if he were an orator. He pointed his index finger at me and made his head shiver.  
"Man doesn't move between good and evil," he said in a hilariously rhetorical tone, grabbing the salt and pepper shakers in both hands. "His true movement is between negativeness and positiveness."  
He dropped the salt and pepper and clutched a knife and fork.  
"You're wrong! There is no movement," he continued as if he were answering himself. "Man is only mind!"  
He took the bottle of sauce and held it up. Then he put it down.  
"As you can see," he said softly, "we can easily replace chili sauce for mind and end up saying, 'Man is only chili sauce!' Doing that won't make us more demented than we already are."  
"I'm afraid I haven't asked the right question," I said. "Maybe we could arrive at a better understanding if I asked what one can specifically find in that area beyond the island?"  
"There is no way of answering that. If I would say, 'nothing', **I would only make the nagual part of the tonal**. All I can say is that there, beyond the island, **one finds the nagual**"  
"But, when you call it the nagual, aren't you also placing it on the island?"  
"No. I named it only because I wanted to make you aware of it."  
"All right! But becoming aware of it is the step that has turned the nagual into a new item of my tonal"  
"I'm afraid you do not understand. I have named the **tonal and the nagual as a true pair**. That is all I have done."
