# Dreaming

Below are quotes from the books

## Dreaming is real

"Dreaming is real for a warrior because in it he can act deliberately, he can choose and reject, he can select from a variety of items those which lead to power, and then he can manipulate them and use them, while in an ordinary dream he cannot act deliberately."  
"Do you mean then, don Juan, that dreaming is real?"  
"Of course it is real."  
"As real as what we are doing now?"  
"If you want to compare things, I can say that it is perhaps more real. In dreaming you have power; you can change things; you may find out countless concealed facts; you can control whatever you want." (3)

## Dreaming set up (finding hands)

The trick in learning to set up dreaming is obviously not just to look at things but to sustain the sight of them. Dreaming is real when one has succeeded in bringing everything into focus. Then there is no difference between what you do when you sleep and what you do when you are not sleeping. Do you see what I mean? (3)

He explained that to "set up dreaming" meant to have a concise and pragmatic control over the general situation of a dream, comparable to the control one has over any choice in the desert, such as climbing up a hill or remaining in the shade of a water canyon.  
...  
"You must start by doing something very simple, " he said.  
"Tonight in your dreams you must look at your hands." I laughed out loud. His tone was so factual that it was as if he were telling me to do something commonplace. ...  
"How can I look at my hands in my dreams?"  
"Very simple, focus your eyes on them just like this."  
...  
"You can, of course, look at whatever you goddamn please-your toes, or your belly, or your pecker, for that matter. I said your hands because that was the easiest thing for me to look at. Don't think it's a joke. Dreaming is as serious as seeing or dying or any other thing in this awesome, mysterious world.  
...  
"Every time you look at anything in your dreams it changes shape, " he said after a long silence. "The trick in learning to set up dreaming is obviously not just to look at things but to sustain the sight of them. Dreaming is real when one has succeeded in bringing everything into focus. Then there is no difference between what you do when you sleep and what you do when you are not sleeping. Do you see what I mean?" (3)

I told him that I had been recording all the details of my dreams. Since I had begun to practice looking at my hands my dreams had become very compelling and my sense of recall had increased to the point that I could remember minute details. He said that to follow them was a waste of time, because details and vividness were in no way important.  
"Ordinary dreams get very vivid as soon as you begin to set up dreaming" he said. "That vividness and clarity is a formidable barrier and you are worse off than anyone I have ever met in my life. You have the worst mania. You write down everything you can."  
...  
"Drop it!" he said imperatively. "It's not helping anything. All you're doing is distracting yourself from the **purpose of dreaming, which is control and power.**"
He lay down and covered his eyes with his hat and talked without looking at me.  
"I'm going to remind you of all the techniques you must practice, " he said. "First you must **focus your gaze on your hands as the starting point. Then shift your gaze to other items and look at them in brief glances. Focus your gaze on as many things as you can. Remember that if you only glance briefly the images do not shift. Then go back to your hands.**  
"Every time you look at your hands you renew the power needed for dreaming, so in the beginning **don't look at too many things. Four items will suffice every time**. Later on, you may enlarge the scope until you can cover all you want, but as soon as the images begin to shift and you feel you are losing control go back to your hands.

I told him that it had been easy in the beginning, but that at the moment I had ceased altogether to find my hands in my dreams.  
"When you first started dreaming you were using my personal power, that's why it was easier, " he said. "Now you are empty. But you must keep on trying until you have enough power of your own. You see, dreaming is the not-doing of dreams, and as you progress in your not-doing you will also progress in dreaming. The trick is not to stop looking for your hands, even if you don't believe that what you are doing has any meaning. In fact, as I have told you before, a warrior doesn't need to believe, because as long as he keeps on acting without believing he is not-doing." We looked at each other for a moment.  
"There is nothing else I can tell you about dreaming." he continued. "Everything I may say would only be not-doing. But if you tackle not-doing directly, you yourself would know what to do in dreaming. To find your hands is essential, though, at this time, and I am sure you will." 

## Travel

"The next step in setting up dreaming is to learn to travel, " he said. "The same way you have learned to look at your hands you can will yourself to move, to go places. First you have to establish a place you want to go to. Pick a well known spot-perhaps your school, or a park, or a friend's house then, will yourself to go there.  
"This technique is very difficult. You must perform two tasks: You must will yourself to go to the specific locale; and then, when you have mastered that technique, you have to learn to control the exact time of your traveling."  
As I wrote down his statements I had the feeling that I was really nuts. I was actually taking down insane instructions, knocking myself out in order to follow them. I experienced a surge of remorse and embarrassment. (3)

He asked me about my progress in "dreaming."  
I had begun to dream about specific places, such as the school and the houses of a few friends.  
"Were you at those places during the day or during the night?" he asked.  
My dreams corresponded to the time of the day when I ordinarily was accustomed to being at those places - in the school during the day, at my friends' houses at night.  
He suggested that I should try "dreaming" while I took a nap during the daytime and find out if I could actually visualize the chosen place as it was at the time I was "dreaming."  
If I were "dreaming" at night, my visions of the locale should be of night time. He said that what one experiences in "dreaming" has to be congruous with the time of the day when "dreaming" was taking place; otherwise the visions one might have were not "dreaming" but ordinary dreams.  
"In order to help yourself you should pick a specific object that belongs to the place you want to go and focus your attention on if, " he went on. "On this hilltop here, for instance, you now have a specific bush that you must observe until it has a place in your memory. You can come back here while dreaming simply by recalling that bush, or by recalling this rock where we are sitting, or by recalling any other thing here. It is easier to travel in dreaming when you can focus on a place of power, such as this one. But if you don't want to come here you may use any other place. Perhaps the school where you go is a place of power for you. Use it. Focus your attention on any object there and then find it in dreaming.  
"From the specific object you recall, you must go back to your hands and then to another object and so on. (3)

## Headband

> I explained to him how difficult it had become for me to give myself the command to look at my hands. At first it had been relatively easy, perhaps because of the newness of the concept. I had had no trouble at all in reminding myself that I had to look at my hands. But the excitation had worn off and some nights I could not do it at all.  
"You must wear a headband to sleep, " he said. "Getting a headband is a tricky maneuver. I cannot give you one, because you yourself have to make it from scratch. But you cannot make one until you have had a vision of it in dreaming. See what I mean? The headband has to be made according to the specific vision. And it must have a strip across it that fits tightly on top of the head. Or it may very well be like a tight cap. Dreaming is easier when one wears a power object on top of the head. You could wear your hat or put on a cowl, like a friar, and go to sleep, but those items would only cause intense dreams, not dreaming." 
He was silent for a moment and then proceeded to tell me in a fast barrage of words that the vision of the headband did not have to occur only in "dreaming" but could happen in states of wakefulness and as a result of any far-fetched and totally unrelated event, such as watching the flight of birds, the movement of water, the clouds, and so on.
