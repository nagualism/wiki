# Dreaming

## Dreaming is real

> "Dreaming is real for a warrior because in it he can act deliberately, he can choose and reject, he can select from a variety of items those which lead to power, and then he can manipulate them and use them, while in an ordinary dream he cannot act deliberately."  
"Do you mean then, don Juan, that dreaming is real?"  
"Of course it is real."  
"As real as what we are doing now?"  
"If you want to compare things, I can say that it is perhaps more real. In dreaming you have power; you can change things; you may find out countless concealed facts; you can control whatever you want."

> The trick in learning to set up dreaming is obviously not just to look at things but to sustain the sight of them. Dreaming is real when one has succeeded in bringing everything into focus. Then there is no difference between what you do when you sleep and what you do when you are not sleeping. Do you see what I mean?

## Dreaming set up

> He explained that to "set up dreaming" meant to have a concise and pragmatic control over the general situation of a dream, comparable to the control one has over any choice in the desert, such as climbing up a hill or remaining in the shade of a water canyon.
> ...  
> "You must start by doing something very simple, " he said.  
> "Tonight in your dreams you must look at your hands." I laughed out loud. His tone was so factual that it was as if he were telling me to do something commonplace.  
> ...  
> "How can I look at my hands in my dreams?"  
> "Very simple, focus your eyes on them just like this." 
> ...  
> "You can, of course, look at whatever you goddamn please-your toes, or your belly, or your pecker, for that matter. I said your hands because that was the easiest thing for me to look at. Don't think it's a joke. Dreaming is as serious as seeing or dying or any other thing in this awesome, mysterious world.  
> ...  
> "Every time you look at anything in your dreams it changes shape, " he said after a long silence. "The trick in learning to set up dreaming is obviously not just to look at things but to sustain the sight of them. Dreaming is real when one has succeeded in bringing everything into focus. Then there is no difference between what you do when you sleep and what you do when you are not sleeping. Do you see what I mean?"
