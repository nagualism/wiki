# Will

'Will' was another concept which don Juan had delineated with great care, but without making it clear. I had gathered from his explanations that 'will' was a **force that emanated from the umbilical region** through an unseen opening below the navel; an opening he had called the 'gap'. 'Will' was allegedly cultivated only by sorcerers. It came to the practitioners veiled in mystery, and purportedly gave them the capacity to perform extraordinary acts.  
I remarked to don Juan that there was no chance that anything so vague could ever be a functioning unit in my life.  
"That's where you're wrong," he said. "The will develops in a warrior in spite of every opposition of the reason."
