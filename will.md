# Will

'Will' was another concept which don Juan had delineated with great care, but without making it clear. I had gathered from his explanations that 'will' was a **force that emanated from the umbilical region** through an unseen opening below the navel; **an opening he had called the 'gap'**. 'Will' was allegedly cultivated only by sorcerers. It came to the practitioners veiled in mystery, and purportedly gave them the capacity to perform extraordinary acts.  
I remarked to don Juan that there was no chance that anything so vague could ever be a functioning unit in my life.  
"That's where you're wrong," he said. "The will develops in a warrior in spite of every opposition of the reason."
