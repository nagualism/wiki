# Totality of oneself

He then spilled some ashes on the ground by the lantern covering an area about two feet square, and drew a diagram with his fingers; a diagram that had eight points interconnected with lines. It was a geometrical figure.

He had drawn a similar one years before when he tried to explain to me that it was not an illusion that I had observed the same leaf falling four times from the same tree.  
The diagram in the ashes had two epicenters. One he called **'reason'**, and the other **'will'**.  
'Reason' was interconnected directly with a point he called '**talking**'. Through 'talking', 'reason' was indirectly connected to three other points: '**feeling**', '**dreaming**' and '**seeing**'. The other epicenter, 'will', was directly connected to 'feeling', 'dreaming' and 'seeing'; but only indirectly connected to 'reason' and 'talking'.  
I remarked that the diagram was different from the one I had recorded years before.  
"The outer form is of no importance," he said. "These points represent a human being, and can be drawn in any way you want."  
"Do they represent the body of a human being?" I asked.  
"Don't call it the body," he said. "These are **eight points on the fibers of a luminous being**.  
"A sorcerer says, as you can see in the diagram, that a **human being is first of all 'will'**; because 'will' is directly connected to three points: 'feeling', 'dreaming' and 'seeing'.  
"Then next, a human being is 'reason'. This is properly a center that is smaller than 'will'. It is connected only with 'talking'."  
"What are the other two points, don Juan?"  
He looked at me and smiled.  
"You're a lot stronger now than you were the first time we talked about this diagram," he said. "But you're not yet strong enough to know all the eight points. Genaro will someday show you the other two."  
"Does everybody have those eight points or only sorcerers?"  
"We may say that every one of us brings to the world eight points. Two of them- 'reason' and 'talking'- are known by everyone. 'Feeling' is always vague but somehow familiar. But only in the world of sorcerers does one get fully acquainted with 'dreaming', 'seeing', and 'will'.  
"And finally, at the outer edge of that world one encounters the other two. **The eight points make the totality of oneself.**"  
He showed me in the diagram that in essence all the points could be made to connect with one another indirectly.  
I asked him again about the two mysterious remaining points. He showed me that they were connected only to 'will' and that they were removed from 'feeling', 'dreaming' and 'seeing'; and much more distant from 'talking' and 'reason'. He pointed with his finger to show that they were isolated from the rest and from each other.  
"Those two points will never yield to 'talking' or to 'reason'," he said. "Only 'will' can handle them. 'Reason' is so removed from them that it is utterly useless to try figuring them out. This is one of the hardest things to realize. After all, the forte of 'reason' is to reason out everything."  
I asked him if the eight points corresponded to areas or to certain organs in a human being.  
"They do," he replied dryly and erased the diagram.  
He touched **my head** and said that that **was the center of 'reason' and 'talking'.** The tip of my **sternum was the center of 'feeling'**. The area **below the navel was 'will'.** **'Dreaming' was on the right side against the ribs. 'Seeing' on the left**. He said that **sometimes in some warriors** **'seeing' and 'dreaming' were on the right side.** \(4\)
